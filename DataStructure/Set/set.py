# Sets in Python are collections of unique and unordered elements.
# They are useful for storing items where duplicates are not allowed and for performing various operations like union, intersection, and difference.
# Python provides several built-in methods to work with sets.

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(fruits)  # Output: {'orange', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'}
