What is PIP?
PIP stands for "Pip Installs Packages" and is the default package manager for Python.
It allows you to install and manage additional Python libraries and dependencies that aren't included in the standard Python library.

With PIP, you can easily install, upgrade, and remove Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other sources.
"""

"""
Why Use PIP?
Access to Thousands of Libraries: PIP connects you to PyPI, which hosts thousands of third-party libraries and tools, 
making it easy to expand your Python projects.
Simple Installation: Installing new libraries with PIP is straightforward, usually requiring just a single command.
Dependency Management: PIP automatically handles dependencies, 
ensuring that any additional libraries required by the package are also installed.

"""
#### **1. Installing a Package**

To install a package, use the `pip install` command followed by the package name.

```bash
# Install a package
!pip install requests
```

This command installs the `requests` package, which allows you to make HTTP requests in Python.



#### **2. Listing Installed Packages**

You can list all the installed packages in your environment using the `pip list` command.

```bash
# List installed packages
!pip list
```

This will show you a list of all the packages installed in your environment along with their versions.
